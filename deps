apt-get install -y git build-essential intltool gtk-doc-tools gperf libcap-dev

#? Not in build-dep systemd but seems to work:
apt-get install libgcrypt20-dev

# weirdly systemd complains about libmount but
# the package to install seems to be this one:

sudo apt-get -y install libblkid-dev
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libgio2.0
