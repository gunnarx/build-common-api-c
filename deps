sudo apt-get install -y git build-essential intltool gtk-doc-tools gperf libcap-dev

#? Not in build-dep systemd but seems to work:
sudo apt-get install -y libgcrypt20-dev

# weirdly systemd complains about libmount but
# libblkid seems needed as well:

sudo apt-get -y install libmount-dev libblkid-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libglib2.0-dev libgio2.0
